The comprehensive open-access dam inventory (DIG) for Germany includes detailed data on 530 dams. This dataset encompasses key information such as dam name, location, associated river, construction and operation start years, crest length, dam height, lake area, lake volume, purpose (e.g., flood control, water supply), dam structure type, and specific building characteristics. Compiled from various sources including books, state agency reports, engineering documents, and internet pages, the DIG employs a priority rule to ensure the highest level of reliability in the provided dam information.
